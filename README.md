# Whack-a-mole game
## Introduction:
```
In Japan, (mogura taiji, "Mole Buster") is a popular arcade game invented in 1975 by Kazuo Yamada of TOGO, based on ten of the designer's pencil sketches from 1974, licensed to Bandai in 1977. It can also be commonly found at Japanese festivals.

The object of the game is to hit a random image moving at a certain speed, thereby adding to the player's score. The more quickly this is done the higher the final score will be.
